I (20M) find out my ex best friend Nick (21M) watches CP. I found out while using his phone that he had nude pictures of his younger sister's best friend after she got out of a shower when she slept over at their house. I obviously told the police what he had and they went over, and sure enough, found it in his phone and omputer. He was charged with possession of CP which is a federal offense, he's going to be facing 30 yrs in prison. But the sad part is what his family is going through, we live in a small Maryland town, so to be expected, news travels fast and soon, his family was being shunned from everything. His dad was fired from his job as a manager of AutoZone, his mom had to quit her job of being an elementary school teacher and I also found out that his sister was being bullied relentlessly in school because of it. I'm starting to feel bad that I just ruined a family, but at the same time, I felt like I did the right thing.

Update: Nick's arrainment was today. Instead of pleading guilty, he decided to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, even though there's literal evidence from the prosecution that proves him wrong, and plus I've known him since we were 7 and he did not once, show any signs of mental disorder. However, fortunately, the judge requested that he doesn't get bail, which means he's staying in prison until his trial date which is in a month, and since he was charged with a federal offense, it will be going to the state's district court. As for his family, I heard that the sister is now being homeschooled by the mom due to the bullying she's faced in school lately. The parents still adamantly believe that their precious son couldn't do no harm.
