# Reddit Video Bot

## Intro
This bot is designed to run via the command line (Windows) or as a bash shell (macOS and Linux).
At its core, the bot will turn text into an AI generated voice over and a given background video will be split to match the length of the generated audio.
The bot relies on the shotstack API for voice rendering, but ptional services (Reddit Scraper, Creatomate, ChatGPT) can optionally be configured to work with the bot to enhance the output of the video and/or bulk render videos from multiple reddit posts.
